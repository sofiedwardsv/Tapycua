      The Ypacaraí lake is one of the two main lakes in Paraguay. Notorious for its cultural influence, from recreational activities to inspiring poetry and music like the well-known song “Recuerdos de Yparacaí” (Memories from Ypacaraí).

         Everything suddenly changed when the deep blue color turned into a worrying shade of green, showing signs of polluted water and endangered water species.

        </div> <p className="color2">
        Dr. Gregor López Moreira, paraguayan researcher, found reasoning in the euthrophication of shallow lakes: 
        Once nutrient levels in a lake go beyond a specific threshold (lake size, depth, sediment, marsh areas), it can only exist in a murky (turbid), phytoplankton-dominated state.
        If we want to make the lake clear again, just reducing nutrients isn't enough. We need to reach a different, lower threshold, below which the lake can only be clear. This strange behavior is because of how the lake's elements interact in these two states.

        <p className="color2">
        Climate is a determinant for the structure and the functioning of an ecosystem.
        José Sapriza and Alicia Pavetti found which climate variables have a “heavier” correlation to the development of eutrophication of the lake.

        In order to restore this ecosystem and protect its biodiversity, we encourage fellow Paraguayans to monitor climate variables and also research about the variety of fishes who live in the Ypacaraí lake.
        This page includes a directory of fish species from the catalog made by the Paraguayan researcher Manuel Simón Insaurralde from the National University of Asunción.   
        And also birds and wildlife characteristic of the basin found in the Management Plan of the lake made for the Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Comunicaciones of Paraguay.
